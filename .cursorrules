When working with this NextJS SaaS boilerplate using BetterAuth, follow these key patterns:

Auth pages (src/app/(auth)/(login|signup)/page.tsx) should remain public and use client components. Keep these pages minimal, delegating most logic to their respective components.

The auth API route (src/app/api/auth/[...all
]/route.ts) must strictly follow the BetterAuth pattern, using the toNextJsHandler utility to handle authentication endpoints.

Protected pages under src/app/(protected)/ must implement proper session checks and client-side redirects. Always include:
- 'use client' directive
- useSession hook for auth state
- useRouter for navigation
- useEffect for redirect logic

Auth components (Login/SignUp) in src/components/ must handle the authentication flow client-side. Required elements:
- 'use client' directive
- useState for form management
- useRouter for post-auth navigation
- authClient for authentication operations

Keep auth configuration split between:
- src/lib/auth.ts for server-side configuration
- src/lib/auth-client.ts for client-side utilities

Follow these patterns strictly to maintain security and consistency across the application.
